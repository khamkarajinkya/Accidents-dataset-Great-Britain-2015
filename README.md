Road accidents are a major source of human and material loss. The department of transport (Great Britain) states that  
1) **There were a total of 186,209 casualties of varying severities**  
2) **140,086 personal-injury road traffic accidents were reported to the police**  
3) **Traffic volumes in 2015 rose by 1.6% compared with 2014**  
  
Through this project, we try modelling the severity of an accident using demographic information about the drivers, vehicle specific information and regional statistics. We base our study on the severity of accidents caused by heavy vehicles. This enabled better visual inference and pattern identification.
